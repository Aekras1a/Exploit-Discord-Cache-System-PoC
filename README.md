# Discord Cache Exploit PoC

 Remote upload embedded payload from image using EOF to any Discord user's machine through cache.
 
Depending on how NodeJS and Discord's cache system works, you could potentially make this a full remote code execution exploit.

## Step-by-step

### Step 1

Embed payload to an image that's less than 256 kb of size:
 `python3 embed.py <image> <python payload>`
 
For this proof-of-concept, my payload is:
```py
print('Hello world'!)
```

### Step 2

Upload the image with the embedded payload to a Discord server as an emoji.

### Step 3

Send the emoji in a text channel. Any member that displays that emoji will automatically download it with the embedded payload to cache.

### Step 4

Make victim run **victim.py**. The script will find and execute the embedded payload from the image in cache.
